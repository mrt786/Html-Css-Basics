Selectors:
    universal selector *{}
    descendent Selectors div p{} or class , elements
    div ma jo p ho ga un par ho ga style

Adjacent sibling Combinator:
    p + h3
    applies the style to h3 that are immediately after p. Both are of the same level is ma kuch levels ko miss kar sakta ha
child Combinator:
(direct descendent)(jo ka bilkul next ha ye nhi ka sab par like div ma p ha next ol then li to div sa only p par ho sakta ha)
    parent > child

attribute selector:
    element[att = "value"]
    wo attributes jin ki yahe specific value ha us par apply ho ga 
    input[type = "text"]
    input[type]
    agar aisa ha tb hi ho jata ha on the basis of attribute bhi ho sakta ha
    search in the attribute selector and there are different types of the Selectors (mdn)
    id > class > element priority

    To find the priority in the selectors find the three digit value:
        id , class , element
            like in the descendent selector it if there is two types of selectors the element is 2
                for class set the others to zero it will be 10
        all of this is for the same property
    
Pseudo class:
    syntax:
        element: PseudoCLASS
     
     Hover:
        (specificity)
    Active:
        when we click on the...
    Checked: usually on radio or checkboxes
    div:nth-of-type(2n): every even
        for the evens or for the odd ones
Pseudo elements:
    ::first-letter
    ::first-line
    ::selection

if specificity same then the cascading algorithm which says that the one that is at last it executes
    inline > id > class > element


search color pallets to make a good website i.e colors.co, canva.com,
