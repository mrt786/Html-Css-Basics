when we make the parent as a flex the inner items become inline
flex direction:
    is by default row we can change this to row
    row-reverse from right to left
    column-reverse from bottom to top
When it overflow then there 
Justify Content:
it is along the main axis
    by default it is start
    space betweeen and around the Content along the main axis
    flex-start: main axis ka start ma align ho jati ha  
    all were arrange along the
    flex-end: main axis ka end ma align ho jati ha

    center:

    space-betweeen: 
        extra space between ma chale jae gi
    space around:
        half of the middle
    space-evenly:
        is sa betweeen and at corner same ho gi elements ka 

flex wrap:
flex wrap kia karta ha ka agar 1 line ma space na ho our hum chahta  ha ka elements ko utni hi space mila jitni unki width and height.
        when there is no space on online moves on the other nowrap(by default)
        wrap-reverse: in the reverse direction along the cross axis
align-items:
    moves when there is a space
    flex-start: along the cross axis sets the elements 

    flex-end: along the cross axis sets the elements from the end
    center:

    baseline:
        makes the text/Content i.e Content height becomes same on the same line if the size of the elements is different

align-Content:
    along the cross axis
    flex-start , flex-end , center, evenly, around, betweeen, baseline


align self:
    only for the individual and it has higher priority

flex-sizing:
    items can be grow or shrink

    flex-basis:
        set's the size for the main size i.e if row alignment then it is width i.e main size other it will be column. alignment is the flex direction
        if the space is empty along the main axis then it increases by a factor
    flex-grow:
         by default it is 1
         it is n times the space
        can also make flex-width: so that it cannot exceed the desired
        min-width;
    flex-shrink:
        short hand for writing flex are:
        flex:
            grow|shrink|basis
            grow|basis
            if unitless then only for the grow
            if unit then it is basis
