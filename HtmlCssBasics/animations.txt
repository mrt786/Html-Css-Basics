Animation: 
    // it is also name is as a template
    @keyframe Animationname
    from{property: initial val;} 
    to{final val;}

    animation-iteration count: how many time you want to see i.e n times or infinite
    animation direction:
        normal(from start to end) , reverse(from end to start) , alternate(both from start to end and end to start i.e starts from start) , alternate-re(starts from end)
    search animation-timing-function: easein, easeout
    define the properties of the iteration where you want to use them i.e in the class or element


    shorthand: 
        Animationname duration timingfunctio easein delay iteration/times direction



    if we want the animation to work in the stages:
    it can be many
     from is the 0% , 100% is the to:
        we wrote like this:
            0%{}
            50%{}
            100%{}
